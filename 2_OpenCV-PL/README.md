## OpenCV on Programmable Logic

This part teaches you how to implement accelerated image processing functions on FPGA, using Vitis Vision Library - namespace xf::cv.

## How to study
- [PYNQ_HLS_ZCU104_PZU.pdf](HLS_Kernels/PYNQ_HLS_ZCU104_PZU.pdf): How to implement the kernels using Vitis_HLS and Vivado, then examine on PYNQ Jupyter Lab.
- [hls_kernels.zip](HLS_Kernels/hls_kernels.zip): Source code used in the tutorial.
